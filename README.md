**You must have either received an invite link prior to setting up an account or after the account is created in order to access the streaming server!**

To create an account, head to https://www.plex.tv/sign-up/ and sign up using OAuth or an email & password.

Once you have created an account select GET STARTED and click the x on the Streaming Services window.

Afterwards, ignore all the tv shows you see on screen -- they are just advertisements from Apple TV, Hulu, Netflix, etc.
Select settings in the top right > Online Media Sources > Disable all 3 sources.
