# Plex Setup - ReadMe
> You must have either received an invite link via email or accepted the invite from Plex's UI via Settings > Manage Library Access > Requests in order to get access to the server. Otherwise you will have an empty Plex dashboard!

> Ask for an invite or just use the discord bot

## Setting up an account

To create an account, head to https://www.plex.tv/sign-up/ and sign up using OAuth or an email & password.

Once you have created an account select GET STARTED and click the x on the Streaming Services window to close out of it, adding other services does nothing, I promise.

Afterwards, ignore all the tv shows you see on screen -- they are just advertisements from Apple TV, Hulu, Netflix, etc.
Select settings in the top right > Online Media Sources > **Disable all 3 sources.**

> You can enable these sources, but you will need to pay for Plex Premium in order for them to work, which is pointless since the server is literally free to use with more content.

## Getting access to the server
After accepting the invite to the server select More on the left toolbar and you should see **Movies, Shows, Anime,** and **Toonz**.

Click the Actions button > Pin. Do this for all 4 sources.
