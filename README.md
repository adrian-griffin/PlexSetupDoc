# Plex Setup - ReadMe
> You must have either received an invite link via email or accepted the invite from Plex's UI via Settings > Manage [Library Access](https://app.plex.tv/desktop/#!/settings/manage-library-access) > Requests in order to get access to the server. Otherwise you will have an empty Plex dashboard!
 
> Ask for an invite or just use the discord bot.

## Setting up an account

To create an account, head [here](https://www.plex.tv/sign-up/) and sign up using OAuth or an email & password.

Once you have created an account select *GET STARTED* and click the `x` on the Streaming Services window to close out of it, adding other services does nothing, I promise.

Afterwards, ignore all the tv shows you see on screen -- they are just advertisements from Apple TV, Hulu, Netflix, etc.
Select settings in the top right > Online Media Sources > ***Disable all 3 sources.***

> You can enable these sources, but you will need to pay for Plex Premium in order for them to work, which is pointless since the server is literally free to use with more content.

## Getting access to the server
After accepting the invite to the server select More on the left toolbar and you should see `Movies`, `Shows`, `Anime`, and `Toonz`.

Click the Actions button > Pin. **Do this for all 4 sources.**

> You can unpin `Discover (Beta)` this way as well


***You are now free to navigate the libraries.***

## Useful Info

- When you first select a source (`Shows`,`Movies`, etc.) you will be shown the `Recommended` tab. I would recommend selecting the `Library` tab for each source as it is an easier to understand layout and you can then see everything available currently under each source.

- Plex is available on nearly any device with a screen at this point, it works well on PlayStation, Xbox, Roku, and Mobile from my experience. I assume it works just as well across all platforms.

- You can download any and all files from Plex locally for offline viewing to any device at any time to be used for road trips, pre-planning what you want to watch, etc.

- Feel free to request anything under the sun either via [Overseerr](http://69.4.234.24:55277/) or via the Discord request bot.

> For info about requesting media check out the Request markdown file in the main repo. Located here: [RequestingMedia](https://github.com/adrian-griffin/PlexSetupDoc/blob/main/RequestingMedia.md)

- All shows and anime that are still running will receive new episode releases immediately, often even before they are officially aired on TV or other streaming services like Hulu, HBO Max, etc. i.e. New episode releases for shows will automatically be grabbed and uploaded to the server.

- All upcoming shows, movies, anime, etc. that has been requested or is popular will be grabbed immediately as well. i.e. All new movie or series releases will be immediately grabbed and uploaded if they have been requested (even if the movie is still in cinema, for example).

- 90% of all content is ripped at 1080p and is lossless, but some content is stored at 720p to save space. If there is a series/movie that you would like to be upgraded to a higher resolution, let me know and I will upload the higher res version.
