# Requesting Media How-To

There are two main ways to request media to be added:
1) Requesting via the discord Plex Request Bot
2) Requesting via the Overseerr API

## Discord Bot
The Discord bot will take requests using the following commands: 
```
/request tv
/request tv-tvdb
/request movie
/request movie-tmdb
/help
/ping
```
Request syntax: 
`/request movie 2001 A Space Odyssey` 
- Note that spaces are allowed

## Overseerr
You can access Overseerr here: [Overseerr](http://137.184.3.254:5055/)

Either log in with your Plex account or use the following credentials:

```
Username/Email: calladrian14@gmail.com
Password: password
```

From there you can easily request any show you would like via the interface (Popular media sources are listed at the bottom!)

- If there is a green check-mark in the top right then it means that item is already on the server
- If there is a clock in the top right then it means that item has not aired yet/has not released yet, but it will be grabbed and added to the server as soon as it released (so long as it has been requested)
